### How can we cultivate diverse and inclusive contributor communities?

*Carlos “L05” Garcia opened a conversation about community, drawing on his experiences working with artist collective Complex Movements and the Allied Media Conference. He emphasized that “learning is a multidimensional process” and the importance of unlearning the ways that we internalize patriarchy and white supremacy. Carlos asked:*

> * *How can we build sustainable leadership by thinking about passing the baton?*
> * *How can we have feedback and learning cycles that are iterative, that with each year build and cultivate leadership?*
> * *What are areas where we find challenges? What are areas where we can make space?*
> * *Can we acknowledge that everyone is an expert of their own experience?*

Key themes that emerged in discussion included:

* Representation
* Project Values
* Barriers
* Training and Mentorship for Users and Contributors
* Visibility
* Promoting Interaction
