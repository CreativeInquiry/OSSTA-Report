## I. Preface

We are pleased to share this report documenting a convening on Open Source Software Toolkits for the Arts (OSSTA), organized by Golan Levin and Lauren Lee McCarthy in Minneapolis, Minnesota on June 2–3, 2018. This event was a one-day conversation and ‘unconference’, populated by founders, maintainers, and contributors of open-source arts-engineering tools such as [Processing](https://processing.org/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/), [three.js](https://threejs.org/), and more. Grants officers from The Knight Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) also took part in the discussions, as well as a handful of volunteers and support staff. 

We hope that this report can function as an examination and a call to action, shining a light on the hard work and labor of contributing artists, designers, engineers, and community members. The organizers’ goal for this report is to generate new opportunities for understanding, recognizing, and supporting work in this field. 

At the same time, we recognize that there are many more toolkits, contributors, and perspectives than those represented by this one convening. We see this as a conversation that can hopefully spark others and contribute to an ongoing dialogue.

We offer our deepest gratitude to the participants of the convening, and the many, many other contributors to these toolkits, without whom, the field of art and technology would not exist. We would also like to thank Tom Hughes and the support staff from the [Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry](https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University for making this event possible, and Taeyoon Choi who assisted in facilitation. Finally, we would like to thank the sponsors of this event, including The Knight Foundation; The National Endowment for the Arts; The Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University; UCLA Department of Design | Media Arts; NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Integrated Digital Media; NYU Tisch School of the Arts, Interactive Telecommunications Program; Processing Foundation; University of Denver Emergent Digital Practices; Princeton University StudioLab; Google Creative Lab; and Eyeo Festival.

## II. Summary

On June 2nd and 3rd, 2018, Golan Levin and Lauren Lee McCarthy, professors of media arts, with support from The Knight Foundation, organized a convening on Open Source Software Toolkits for the Arts (OSSTA) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This event was a one-day conversation and ‘unconference’, populated by founders, maintainers, and contributors of open-source arts-engineering tools such Processing, p5.js, openFrameworks, Cinder, three.js, and more. Grants officers from The Knight Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) also took part in the discussions, as well as a handful of volunteers and support staff. The convening took place on the weekend before the 2018 Eyeo Festival, an annual media arts conference in Minneapolis. 

The purpose of the convening, and this report, was to generate a first step towards defining the field of OSSTA, including an articulation of their impact as well as the challenges they face, for a wider audience. To this end, our gathering brought together leaders in the open-source arts community to have an in-depth conversation around the challenges and opportunities facing these platforms—specifically, regarding sustainability, funding, growth, management, diversity, and community building. The labor and impact of these tools, some of which are entering their third decade of existence, has remained under-recognized and under-resourced, putting the ecosystem of artists working with these tools at risk.

Because Open Source Software Toolkits for the Arts are primarily developed online by contributors distributed around the world, it’s rare to get so many project leaders and contributors in one room together. One primary goal of the convening was to foster inter-project dialogue and knowledge sharing that could benefit individual projects as well as the field as a whole.

The organizers’ goal for this report is to generate new opportunities for understanding, recognizing, and supporting work in this field. 

The Convening was organized around a set of six central questions:

1. **Challenges** — What are the biggest challenges in OSSTA?
2. **Developer Operations** — How do we handle growth and management?
3. **Community** — How can we cultivate diverse and inclusive contributor communities?
4. **Funding and Sustainability** — How can we sustain this work?
5. **Values** — How do we describe what we do, and its value?
6. **Futures** — What are the futures we want to see?

Within the following sections, we have identified the key themes that emerged from each of the discussions as well as the challenges and opportunities presented by convening participants.


## III. Participants

Participants were selected for this convening based on a variety of factors including: historical relationships to the tools; unique, under-represented, and/or valuable perspectives and background experience; industry perspectives; pedagogic perspectives, and the constraints of the budget for transcontinental flights. This group was convened to develop and express deep conversations around OSSTA, but in no way was meant to be exclusive of the thousands of other contributors, creators, and toolkits that actively contribute to and maintain these vibrant communities. 

This convening was designed to gather a representative sample of the voices, perspectives, and toolkits that comprised the landscape of open-source software tools for the arts in mid-2018. It is important to recognize the limitations of the two organizers and their ability to know all of the diverse contributors and toolkits out there. The number of participants was limited to 30 based on the resources available and the limits of facilitating and thoroughly documenting multiple conversations taking place within a single day. In this way, the viewpoints expressed here are a snapshot, rather than a comprehensive survey. We see this as one conversation that may hopefully spark others to expand on the perspectives and toolkits represented.

In this convening and report, we use the term “contributor” rather than “developer” to refer to people that work on OSSTAs, acknowledging the huge diversity of contributions including, but not limited to: documentation, teaching, graphic design, illustration, writing, organizing, curating, and software development.

## IV. Field Definition

More than ever, today's media artists create their work using a suite of free programming toolkits made for artists, by artists. These open-source software tools for the arts, or *OSSTAs* — such as Processing, p5.js, and openFrameworks—are created by small, self-organized collectives of artists, designers, and educators in order to fulfill needs that are unmet (and probably unmeetable) by the marketplace. Generally, these toolkits take the form of software libraries: bundles of code, associated documentation, and work examples that are free and accessible. Because they are made by artists for artists, they reflect and respond to the specific needs and vision of artists and designers. This ground-up approach allows for a community to unlock creative potential by defining its own tools, rather than be subject to the whims of major corporations.

Many of these toolkits, in addition to being open-source software (OSS), are also free/libre (altogether, FLOSS). There are many open-source software tools that cost money, and it’s notable that many of these can be downloaded without payment. It’s also one reason they are difficult to maintain. [This essay by Processing co-creator Casey Reas](https://medium.com/processing-foundation/processing-and-floss-d35aa4607f4c) may be a helpful resource for parsing the specific language of “free software” and “open-source software.”

Although these toolkits are developed and maintained by a relatively small number of people, they have become one of the primary means by which hundreds of thousands of artists, designers, and researchers all over the world create their work. Along the way, these toolkits have promoted software literacy within the arts, and arts literacy within technology—with the result that they are now one of the essential set of tools for making media art today. However, OSSTAs are not only used in the arts, they are also used by designers, educators, data visualization experts, scientists, and engineers. They are especially prevalent in education, providing the starting point for millions of students in arts, open-source, and technology fields. 

Despite their widespread use, however, the development of these important toolkits has remained a labor of love: they are often intermittently maintained by widely dispersed individuals, often without pay, in their spare time. This is difficult to sustain, and creates barriers to access for those without the means to volunteer their time. The future of these initiatives is precarious. We seek to address this by creating contexts to strengthen these tools and to support the vibrant artist communities that have grown from them. Because these tools are created by few but used by many, we are confident that every “dollar in” is returned to the public many times over.

The first set of beneficiaries for this gathering are the 30 media artists invited to represent their toolkits. These individuals are true hybrids: artists who do their own, highly competent software engineering. Presently, they develop and improve these toolkits, both for themselves and for others, with little or no financial support. Our project benefits these individuals by providing direct support for this activity. By gathering them together for face-to-face collaboration, it also serves to strengthen their communities. The second set of beneficiaries are the (literally) thousands of artists, designers, musicians, students, and researchers who depend on these specific tools to create interactive installations, performances, visualizations, and online experiences. For these communities, the expected benefit is a set of tools to create their work that is more robust, more fully-featured, better-documented, and created by and representative of a wider diversity of perspectives.
