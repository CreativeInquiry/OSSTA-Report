#### The National Endowment for the Arts | Media Arts 
Established by Congress in 1965, the NEA is the independent federal agency whose funding and support gives Americans the opportunity to participate in the arts, exercise their imaginations, and develop their creative capacities. Through partnerships with state arts agencies, local leaders, other federal agencies, and the philanthropic sector, the NEA supports arts learning, affirms and celebrates America’s rich and diverse cultural heritage, and extends its work to promote equal access to the arts in every community across America. At the National Endowment for the Arts, media arts includes screen-based projects presented via film, television, radio, audio, video, the Internet, interactive and mobile technologies, video games, transmedia storytelling, and satellite as well as media-related printed books, catalogues, and journals.

#### The Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University 
The Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University is a laboratory for atypical, anti-disciplinary, and inter-institutional research at the intersections of arts, science, technology and culture. Founded in 1989 within the College of Fine Arts at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), the STUDIO serves as a locus for hybrid enterprises on the CMU campus, the Pittsburgh region, and internationally. Our current emphasis on new-media arts builds on more than two decades of experience hosting interdisciplinary artists in an environment enriched by world-class science and engineering departments. Through our residencies and outreach programs, the STUDIO provides opportunities for learning, dialogue and research that lead to innovative breakthroughs, new policies, and the redefinition of the role of artists in a quickly changing world.

#### UCLA Department of Design | Media Arts 
The UCLA Department of Design Media Arts (DMA) offers a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to media creation that fosters individual exploration and innovative thinking. Within the context of the department, design is a process and way of thinking, and media arts foreground experimental media creation. The results emerge in and on books, galleries, game consoles, installations, films, magazines, performances, public spaces, televisions, and websites. We strive to create socially and culturally relevant objects, experiences, and spaces. [http://dma.ucla.edu/](http://dma.ucla.edu/)

#### NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Integrated Digital Media 
The Integrated Digital Media (IDM) Program is a place that fosters creative practice, design research and multidisciplinary experimentation with emerging media technologies. As a research-active program within NYU Tandon School of Engineering, IDM faculty collaborate in research that integrates digital media and society. Our projects range from using motion capture technology to reimagine theatrical performance, to developing novel uses of virtual/augmented reality for health and wellness, to the integration of STEAM learning into special needs education, to the development of citizen science tools to empower NYC residents to monitor and report on noise pollution in their communities, to helping NASA JPL develop next-generation user interfaces for space exploration, to assisting with the search and visualization of the historical record of New York City. Our faculty include leading artists, designers, developers and performers who passionately engage in professional work and research at the intersection of engineering and creative practice.

#### NYU Tisch School of the Arts, Interactive Telecommunications Program 
ITP is a two-year graduate program located in the Tisch School of the Arts whose mission is to explore the imaginative use of communications technologies — how they might augment, improve, and bring delight and art into people's lives. Perhaps the best way to describe us is as a Center for the Recently Possible. [https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp)

#### University of Denver Emergent Digital Practices 
The Emergent Digital Practices program brings together art, design, media, culture and technology studies in a hands-on, collaborative environment. Technology links academic disciplines with professional fields and joins shared communities with our personal lives in many new and exciting ways. To understand and explore this landscape, we infuse the digital practices of making and writing with contemporary critical approaches to cultural technologies, media philosophy, the critique and investigation of electronic and new media arts, and studies in science fiction, trans-global politics and science.

#### Princeton University StudioLab 
The StudioLab is a versatile, welcoming, and engaging space for collaboration and creation across the disciplines. The CST developed the StudioLab to bring together students, faculty, and staff, independent of area of concentration, to explore the intersections and shared creativity across STEM, the arts, humanities, and social sciences, contributing to CST’s efforts to broaden intellectual experiences and perspectives, inspire new synergies, and cultivate creativity. The space features motion capture, virtual reality, theater lighting, sound system, dance flooring, robots, 3D printing, conductive fabric and sewing, laser cutting, CNC milling, electronics, computers, building, and more. Programmatic initiatives include courses, labs, studios, student projects, student-led and staff-led activities and workshops, open creative hours, and thematic “hackathons” on social justice topics. These initiatives advance engagement and diversify participation within and across the disciplines, and offer new opportunities to create community.

#### Google Creative Lab 
Google Creative Lab is a group of interdisciplinary thinkers and doers. We are designers, writers, business leaders, filmmakers, animators, producers, creative technologists, and much more. We are a small team that pushes for an impact that outweighs our footprint.

#### Processing Foundation 
Our mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources. We do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes Processing (Java), p5.js (JavaScript), and Processing.py (Python), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.

#### Eyeo Festival 
The Eyeo Festival brings together a rich intersection of people doing fascinating things with technology. Artists, data designers, creative coders, AI explorers, storytellers, researchers, technology & platform developers all cross paths and share inspiration.
